"The bathroom door squeaks open as Sean wobbles out. He uses his hand on the wall for support."
"{color=#2D70D6}Woah! What happened?{/color}"
r "A- Are you okay?"
s "Oh Reader! You caught me at a bad time…"
"{color=#2D70D6}Why is he rubbing his stomach like that?{/color}"
s "Phew! I no longer feel like a terrorist threat!"
r "Are you sure you’re okay?"
s "Mee? I’m completely fine! Totally."
"{color=#2D70D6}I can’t tell if he’s actually okay…{/color}"
s "Actually - hey Reader, have you ever tried Buldak?"
r "What’s Booldak?"
s "Buldak Instant Noodles - Spicy…"
r "Uhh… I’m not too good with spice…"
r "I usually pass it on to my dad to finish whenever I have anything spicy…"
s "Hmm… In that case - you should get stronger."
r "What?"
s "Stronger! Robust! Becoming more powerful!"
r "What do you mean by that?"
s "In order to become stronger, you need to train!"
r "Train as in… going to the gym?... Have you been working out?"
"{color=#2D70D6}He sure as hell doesn’t look like it…{/color}"
s "No No No…"
s "I’m training my stomach!"
r "Oh."
s "You see… eating spicy food actually makes your stomach resilient and makes your digestive tract able to process other foods easily."
s "So… I’ve been strengthening my stomach using the epitome of spicy food: Buldak Instant Noodles!"
"{color=#2D70D6}That logic seems a bit skewed…{/color}"
"{color=#2D70D6}And why specifically instant noodles?{/color}"
"{color=#2D70D6}And why specifically this brand??{/color}"
s "There’s the 1x spice - and that’s already really spicy!"
s "But it can go all the way to 2x and 3x! Rumour has it 4x exists! :o"
r "…"
s "You should train with me. I’ll cook one up for you next time!"
r "Ah…"
s "That’s a yes right? We’ll become stronger together? :)"
r "H- Hold on… Is that why you came out of the bathroom looking like that?"
s "Uhh…"
s "Ahem. I don’t know what you’re talking about! I was completely fine! Completely and totally fine! I said so - didn’t I?"
r "I thought it was supposed to make you more resilient to spice?"
s "Slowly but surely! It’s been a while since I had my last - give me a break!"
r "Why do you even eat that anyway?"
s "Because it tastes! All my neurons are activated! I feel alive!"
s "And to become stronger! I can feel my gut burning up - it’s like birth pains! Birth pains are a good sign - it's fantastic!"
s "In other words… it feels like callouses- but in your stomach!"
"{color=#2D70D6}Is he a masochist?{/color}"
"{color=#2D70D6}Where is he getting these ideas?{/color}"
r "Haha… As much as I appreciate the offer, I think I’m good…"
s "Aww… Come on… Just a bit?"
r "I don’t think I’ll be roasting my insides today for a bit of “training”."
s "Hmph - fine… fine…"
"As Sean turns around, a sudden jolt of pain doubles him over, likely originating from the after effects of his recent bathroom break. Clenching his stomach, he awkwardly stumbles away."
r "Don’t overdo it! Your stomach is gonna spill out!"
"Ignoring the fact that Sean offered me near-lethal volcano noodles, it’s pretty amusing being around him. I feel like I’ve seen a side that not many have seen before."
